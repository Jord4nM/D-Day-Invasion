        <h2>The build-up to D-Day</h2>
        <p>Since the evacuation from Dunkirk, Allied leaders and military planners had debated about when, where and how
            to
            land tropps in northern Europe. Although plans for such an action had been in the works for years, it was
            not
            until December 1943, when General Dwight D.Eisenhower was appointed Supreme Commander of the Allied
            Expeditionary Force, that preoparations for the furtue operation, code named OVERLORD, intensified.</p>
        <p>The buildup for an eventual cross-Channel action had begun in 1942, but a lack of resources and strategic
            shifts
            in the European theater moved the Allied invasion of the continent to 1944. Although the invasion was
            delayed
            with no definite timeline, American troops begain ariving in Great Britain in record numbers in 1942. By the
            end
            of May 1944, there was more than 1.5 million US Army personnel in the United Kingdon to either participate
            in or
            support the cross-Channel action.</p>

        <h3>Operation Fortitude</h3>
        <p>Operation Fortitude, was an Allied deception operation that was intended to make Nazi Germany's high command
            believe that the main Allied invasion of Europe in 1944 would not be at Normandy. Organized by Allied
            military
            officials beginning in 1943, Operation Fortitude aimed to decieve through the use of a fake army.</p>
        <p>In order to give Operation Overlord the highest chance of success, the Allies believed that they needed to
            utilize deception. In December 1943, the London Controlling Section, a secret group of Allied military
            officers,
            began planning for decoy activities on a large scale. Their overachring operation was code-named Bodyguard;
            Fortitude was a suboperation. While the plan for Overlord was to invade mainland Europe via Normandy,
            Fortitude's goal was to direct German attention to Norway (a part of the operation known as Fortitude North)
            and
            to the Pas-de-Calais region of France (Fortitude South. Military logic was already pushing Nazi commanders
            to
            believe that the Allies would invade Pas-de-Calais--the French region closest to the English coast--but
            Fortitude was a means of reinforcing that belief and thereby increasing the odds that Overlord would
            succedd,
            which in turn would enable Allied forces to establisha foothold in western Europe</p>

    <div class="operationFortitudetwo">
        <h3>Operation Fortitude</h3>
        <p>To make Fortitude's deception more believable, the Allies launched Operation Quicksilver, a suboperation of
            Fortitude, in January 1944. Quicksilver employed a fictitious army known as the First U.S. Army Group
            (FUSAG),
            which was made up of thousands of fake tanks and airplanes as well as decoy buildings and other
            infrastructure
            on England's southeast coast. In addition, U.S. senior officer and soon-to-be four-star general George S.
            Patton
            was declared publicly to be in command of this fictitious army in early 1944. Patton was the general who was
            possibly the most feared and respected by the German high command, and his involvement gave the decoy
            operation
            considerable credibility.</p>
        <p>To deepen the deception, the Allies used a variety of tactics. They generated, for example, radio
            transmissions
            to deceive the Germans into thinking that an invasion would take place at Calais in mid-July 1944. These
            spurious radio transmissions were supported by the work of double agents working for the Allies who fed
            information to Nazi Germany. One of these double agents was Juan Pujol García, who the Germans were so
            impressed
            with that they awarded him an Iron Cross. The Allies also allowed German reconnaissance aircraft to
            photograph
            the site of their ghost army. By this point in World War II, the Allies had cracked the Enigma code as well
            as
            another German encryption system, which meant they could monitor the false information they were pushing
            into
            Germany and assess its effects.</p>
        <p>Fortitude was a success insomuch as it confirmed the belief of many in the German high command that the
            Allies’
            main invasion effort would probably occur in the Pas-de-Calais region. That belief may have also helped
            persuade
            the Germans to withhold reinforcements from Normandy after the actual Allied invasion had begun there on
            June 6,
            1944. Fortitude was one of many complex overlapping operations and factors that contributed to Allied forces
            establishing themselves in France and eventually defeating Nazi Germany.</p>
