        <h2>D-Day</h2>
        <p>D-Day was the larget invasion ever assembled. 156,000 Allied troops landed, by sea and air, on five
            beacheads, in Normandy, France.</p>
        <p>It was the start of Allied operations in which would ultimately liberate Western Europe, defeat Nazi Germany
            and end the Second World War in Europe.</p>
        <h3>Why is the term 'D-Day' used?</h3>
        <p>The date and time of military operations are not always known when it's being planned. Therefore the term
            'D-Day' was used to mean the date on which operations would begin in Europe, whatever that date was.</p>
        <h3>What does the 'D' stand for?</h3>
        <p>The 'D' does not stand for anything. You may have seen in books or online, or heard in tv shows and films
            that it stood for 'Deliverance', 'Doom', 'Debarkation' or similar words. The 'D' doesn't actually stand for
            anything, it's derived from the word 'day'. Whilst 'D-Day' is still used for military operations, the
            general public generally refer to the Allied landing in Normandy on 6th June 1944.</p>
